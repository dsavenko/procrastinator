## Hi, this is Procrastinator!

Procrastinator gathers news and articles from other resources and shows them one by one.

It remembers articles you've seen and doesn't show them again.

You can change information sources. There are some presets, but you can add any RSS feeds. I.e. Procrastinator can serve as an online RSS reader.

**Discontinued**

The Web version of Procrastinator is discontinued and replaced with the [mobile application](https://dsavenko.com).
